The project is a mini multi-users and multi-sessions online chatting software in Java. It can support easy chatting  sessions that users can choose to join, kind of like the original version of QQ in China. You can use it following the process in the report, but it is all in Chinese. The design is quite simple with several buttons and user interfaces. You can register, log in, query all sessions, create or join in the sessions with ID, send the message in a session, exit the session and query all users online. Users can send to each other if they join in the same session.



It is a project I have done when I first learned to use Java, so there might be many nonstandard in the code file, you may not always be practiced and perfect.



It is now not translated into English, so still in Chinese.
You can preview the code first and see the pictures of the report if you like.

Later maybe I will translate more into English for you to see!
